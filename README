Deutschland radio has chandged their website so nothing of this works any longer.
sorry for us.
title of repository : dradio-app_on_firefox

These 2 files start firefox and play the Deutschlandradio audio app.
This has been tested with current debian 10.3, 
mate 1.20.4, X Server xorg (1:7.7+19), firefox-esr 68.5.0esr (64-Bit)
The theme has an influence on the window size due to the thickness of the window frame. 
I tested successfully with mate theme TraditionalGreen.

A switch -debug on position 1 may be set in the calling *.desktop file

Your mileage may vary with other packages, reports are welcome. 
It is advisable to allow audio play for the website in the browsers preference setting. 
see preferences-foto*.png
It ist advisable to adjust #geometry settings, if your desktop shows a different layout.

bugs : 

dradio.bash:
1. The syntax of the script may be improved forever.
2. When killing an existing firefox-window, the new window might start with two tabs of dradio

dradio.firefox-esr.desktop
1. Strings in other languages than 'de' and 'en' are open to improvement.
Please supply a correct string in your mother language, if you know a better one.

An install and remove script is supplied maybe later
My script is for a dual monitor hardware setup.
change your geometry in dradio.conf.
